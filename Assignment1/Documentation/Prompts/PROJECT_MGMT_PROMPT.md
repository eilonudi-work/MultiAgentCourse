**Goal:** Create a comprehensive, phase-based development program for the **Local LLM Chat Web Application** using the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD) and User Experience (UX) Specification.

**Plan Focus:** Deliver a plan for the **full, final product**.

**Required Deliverable Structure:** A structured project plan divided into three logical phases: **Setup & Core API**, **Feature Development & UX Polish**, and **Security & Launch Prep**.

### 1. ⚙️ Phase 1: Foundation & Core API Integration

- **Objective:** Securely connect the web app to Ollama and establish the communication backbone.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Set up the full **Web Application architecture** (Frontend).
  - Implement the initial setup flow for secure input and persistence of the **API Key** and Ollama URL.
  - Establish the complete, authenticated communication logic for listing models (`/api/tags`) and handling chat requests.

### 2. 💬 Phase 2: Full Feature & UX Implementation

- **Objective:** Implement all required chat features and polish the user experience to match the UX specification's design.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Implement **Real-time Streaming Output** for all model responses.
  - Build the complete, responsive UI, including the **Conversation Sidebar**, **Model Selector**, and **System Prompt editor**.
  - Implement robust, persistent **Conversation History** management.
  - Ensure the application is fully functional and responsive on both desktop and mobile web.

### 3. ✅ Phase 3: Hardening, QA & Launch

- **Objective:** Ensure the application is stable, secure, and ready for deployment.
- **Key Tasks:**
  - Implement all **Advanced Error Handling** (e.g., specific messages for server down, invalid API key, etc.).
  - Conduct a full **Quality Assurance (QA)** pass to resolve all bugs and design inconsistencies.
  - Finalize all documentation, including deployment and user guides.

**Action:** Generate the full-scope, phase-based development program, listing tasks under each phase and providing an overall **time estimate** (e.g., 6-8 weeks total).
