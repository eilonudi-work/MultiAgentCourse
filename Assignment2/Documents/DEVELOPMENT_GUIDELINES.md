## 1. Project Documentation

### 1.1. README

- **User Manual Level:** The README must function as a complete **user manual**, including detailed installation, operation, configuration, and troubleshooting instructions.

---

## 2. Code Quality & Structure

The code must exhibit high **modularity** and strict **separation of responsibilities**.

- **High Modularity:** The codebase must be organized into clear, reusable, and independent modules.
- **Separation of Concerns (SOC):** Strict adherence to SOC, ensuring each part of the system (module, class, function) has **a single, well-defined responsibility**.
- **Perfect Project Structure (Best Practices):** Adherence to a standard, clean directory structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `config/`, etc.) with consistent naming conventions.

---

## 3. Configuration & Security

Professional management of project settings and adherence to security principles are expected.

- **Configuration Files:** Use separate, documented configuration files (`.env`, `.yaml`, etc.).
- **No Hardcoding:** Absolutely **no hardcoded constants** for environment-dependent variables.
- **Secrets Management:** Strict adherence to security standards, ensuring **API keys and secrets are loaded via environment variables** and are excluded from source control (`.gitignore`).

---

## 4. Testing & Quality Assurance

Testing must be **comprehensive** and measured against a high standard.

- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes a mix of **Unit and Integration tests** covering all critical business logic and common paths.
- **High Code Coverage (70%-85%):** Achieved test coverage must be in the target range of **70% to 85%**, focusing on the most critical paths and components.
- **Error Handling:** Robust and well-documented **error handling** across all layers, with clear error messages and detailed logs for debugging.

---

## 5. Research & Analysis (If Applicable)

When analysis or ML components are involved, an **in-depth, measurable research effort** is mandatory.

- **Substantial Research:** Show evidence of a **systematic and methodical research process**.
- **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis:** Detailed analysis of **parameter sensitivity**, identifying which parameters are critical and how they affect the results.
- **Analysis Notebook:** A well-organized Jupyter Notebook (or similar) detailing the entire process, including **mathematical formulas (using LaTeX)** and deep, methodical analysis.

---

## 6. UI/UX & Results Presentation

The user interface and presentation of findings must be of high quality.

- **Quality User Interface (UI):** The interface must be **clear, intuitive, and professional**.
- **Impressive Visual Presentation:** Results must be presented using **high-quality, professional graphs and visualizations** that effectively communicate the findings (clear labels, legends, high resolution).

---

## 7. Optimization & Costs (Expected Extra)

- **Documented Costs and Optimization Analysis:** Include documentation detailing the system's **running costs** and a formal **optimization analysis** showing efforts to improve efficiency (e.g., speed, memory, or cost).

---

This focused document includes only the elements described in your lecture's expectations for a grade in the 80%-89% range, highlighting the high standards for documentation, code quality, testing, and analysis.

Would you like me to focus in on any single category and provide even more detail on how to achieve this level of quality?
